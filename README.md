# ProcrastinationBuster
The idea is simple: every time I feel the urge to procrastinate, I have to learn a new algorithm and put something here. After that I'll (hopefully) be too mentally tired to procrastinate.

# So far:
* Bellman-Ford algorithm
* Levenshtein Edit Distance
* Floyd's cycle finding algorithm
* Floyd-Warshall algorithm
* Dijkstra's algorithm
